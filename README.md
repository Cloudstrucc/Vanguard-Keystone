# Employee Onboarding and ID Verification Process

This document outlines the complete user journey for employee onboarding, including identity verification, DID wallet setup, and integration with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Onboarding Journey

### 1. Admin Initiates Employee Onboarding

1. Administrator creates a new user profile in the Admin Portal
2. System provisions a preliminary account in Microsoft Entra ID
3. Administrator configures access permissions and building access zones
4. System generates a unique invitation code and QR code
5. Administrator sends the invitation email to the new employee

### 2. Employee Receives Invitation

1. Employee receives the email with:
   - Welcome message and company information
   - Link to download the DID Wallet app (iOS/Android/Web)
   - QR code for automatic onboarding
   - Text-based invitation code (as backup)

2. Email clearly explains:
   - Purpose of the DID wallet
   - Requirement for official ID verification
   - What to expect during the process
   - Privacy protection measures

### 3. DID Wallet Installation

1. Employee installs the DID Wallet app on their preferred device
2. Employee scans the QR code or enters the invitation code
3. App establishes connection with the organization's identity service
4. App provides clear instructions for the identity verification process

### 4. Identity Verification Process

#### ID Document Verification
1. Employee is prompted to select ID type (driver's license, passport, etc.)
2. App provides instructions for proper document scanning
3. Employee captures front and back of ID document
4. System performs real-time authenticity checks:
   - Document tampering detection
   - Hologram/security feature verification
   - OCR extraction of document data
   - Cross-validation with organizational records

#### Facial Biometric Verification
1. Employee is prompted for a selfie photo
2. App includes liveness detection measures:
   - Random head movement instructions
   - Eye blink detection
   - Changing facial expressions
   - Background environment analysis
2. System performs facial comparison between selfie and ID photo
3. AI algorithms calculate match confidence score
4. Additional verification steps triggered if match score is below threshold

#### Verification Review
1. System performs automated verification checks
2. For high-risk scenarios, optional manual review by authorized personnel
3. Clear status updates provided to employee during the process
4. Upon successful verification, system creates the employee's DID

### 5. DID Creation and Credential Issuance

1. System generates cryptographic key pairs for the employee
2. DID is created using Microsoft ION method (did:ion:...)
3. DID is registered with the organization's identity service
4. System issues the following Verifiable Credentials:
   - Employee Badge Credential
   - Building Access Credential (with specific access zones)
   - Email Signing Credential
   - Document Signing Credential

### 6. Microsoft Entra ID & Verified ID Integration

1. System links the employee's DID to their Microsoft Entra ID account
2. Microsoft Verified ID issues additional credentials
3. Passwordless authentication is enabled for Microsoft 365 services
4. DID is registered as the primary authentication method

### 7. Digital Badge Creation

1. System generates digital badge for building access
2. Badge includes:
   - Employee photo from verification process
   - Name and employee ID
   - Department and role
   - Access level indicators
   - QR/NFC capabilities for scanning

2. Badge is formatted for Apple/Google Wallet:
   - Native iOS Wallet format
   - Google Pay/Wallet pass
   - Visual indicators for access levels
   - Tap-to-authenticate capability

### 8. Onboarding Completion

1. Employee receives confirmation of successful onboarding
2. App displays all issued credentials and their purpose
3. Digital badge is added to Apple/Google Wallet
4. Quick tutorial guides employee on:
   - Building access
   - Microsoft 365 sign-in
   - Digital document signing
   - Encrypted email usage

## Identity Verification Technical Implementation
